# Vido Image Viewer
A simple, lightweight, fast and sexy image viewer.

## About
Every operating system has one included. There are tons of alternatives, supporting every imaginable image format, include handy image editing functions - and most of them are free, well-tested and have a big community. Why create yet another image viewer then?

The answer is simple: Because I couldn't find one I was *really* happy with.

I want an image viewer that is fast, doesn't annoy me with an overloaded Windows 95-like UI full of buttons or image editing features *I don't fucking need when looking at memes*. I just want an intuitive and customizable input scheme... and a dark theme. And so I did what most programmers would probably do: I made my own.

### The result

## Features
- Supports JPG, PNG, TIFF and (animated) GIF
- Intuitively controllable by keyboard, mouse, remote controls...
- Completely customizable key mappings and design
- Probably works on Linux as well (using mono)
- Sometimes randomly crashes at weird image files or cryptic file names

### Planned future features
- Support for VR/Side-by-side and 360Â° pictures
- Smoother animations for larger pictures
- Less random program crashes at weird image files or cryptic file names

## Current project state
As implied, the current version was created one year ago within a few days. It lacks proper documentation and testing and will get a complete rewrite once I'm done with my current project. Until then, however, I'd love to get constructive criticism about it - do you like the default input scheme or have you customized it to something else? What do you find unintuitive? How do you use the application? Let me know - and I can use this feedback to create an even better final version!
